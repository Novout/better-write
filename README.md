# An Editor for Creative Writing

Unlike traditional text flows, *betterwrite* focuses on producing an out-of-the-curve experience for writers and writing derivatives, bringing with it several additional tools to increase the flow of use:

- **Annotations** have a different editor, based on markdown, offering a more instantaneous and familiar option than the main editor, fulfilling its main purpose: annotating. Annotations do not participate in the document production flow and serve as an aid to the writer.

- **Characters** is a system for identifying specific words and offering some control over them, highlighting the paragraph with colors and their occurrence in the project. This system mainly allows fantasy or drama writers to have greater control of their paragraphs and handle character arcs with perfection.

- **Statistics**

- **Drafts**

- **Corrector**

- **Insert Shortcuts**

Furthermore, the editor is fully customizable with the main focus on emphasizing the writer's creativity and adapting all the context at his disposal.

### Other Project Types

Besides the **creative** mode, the **common** mode is available for the production of simple documents and the **only-annotations** mode for annotating day-to-day tasks and other TODO's.

# Offline First

By default, the editor always tends to maintain compatibility in offline mode, allowing users to continue their work without having their workflow interfered. This is possible thanks to the 100% Client-Side concept, where all the logic and use by the user is on the client side, where the role of authentication and saving in the cloud (void) does not depend on the project, and vice versa.
